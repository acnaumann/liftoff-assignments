## Submission Instructions

### Overview
As someone who always forgets to add some meal ingredient to their shopping list, or consistently walks back and forth through the grocery store to retrieve the items on their list, I wanted to create an app that stores all the ingredients for a meal and allows you to create a weekly meal plan which then auto-populates a grocery list. The list would be sorted by the ingredient's categories, so the user can just check off each item as they shop that section of the grocery store.
